# Covid Tracker

Site is live [here!](https://covid-tracker-1.web.app/) Note that the backend isn't deployed, so it won't work unless you deploy your own backend or host one locally.

### What this is
This web app tells you the current number of COVID-19 cases in your state, as well as other useful information. It is intended to be a quick and easy tool that nearly instantly retrieves relevant data.

### Technologies Used
This is a web app built with React.js, Node.js, and Express.js. It is deployed using Google Firebase. All data comes from [covidtracking.com's](https://covidtracking.com/) API.
